## About JavaScript

JavaScript (sometimes shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well such as [node.js][2].

## Current version

The JavaScript standard is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. A 6th major revision of the standard is being worked on.

A good reference to versions, references and news about JavaScript, you can find at [Mozilla Developer Network][1].
