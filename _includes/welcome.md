# Welcome

Since JavaScript is the most popular language nowadays, there's a lot of obsolete and wrong information about it on the web. This makes new developers propagate bad practices and bad code. This must stop. JS: The Right Way is an easy-to-read, quick reference for JS best practices, accepted coding standards, and links around the Web.

## Attention

This is a work in progress. We are working with the community to create this guide. So if you want to help, feel free to [contribute on GitHub][1].

## Disclaimer

It's important to know that JavaScript has some bad parts, but also does have nice ones! And those nice parts make it worth. It's a fun language to work with, and if you know how to use it in the "right way", you can enjoy programming on it.

We also ensure that there's no really "right way" to work with JavaScript. There's many ways, and this makes each programmer and each language unique. Here we just introduce new JavaScript developers and also experienced ones to follow best practices and get references, such as follow the creators and big names of JavaScript community.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information and examples as they become available.
